			<p class="center"> I was born on Decemeber 17, 1990 in Nairobi, Kenya. I have three brothers, one older and two younger.  At 3 1/2 years of age my older brother, mother, and I moved to Maryland. My father stayed in Kenya. Since then I have been back and forth between the countries, spending my school years in America and my summers in Kenya.</p>

			<p class="center"> I went to College at Indiana University. I studied psychology with the intent of becoming a clinical psychologist. During my last semester I worked at a psychologist's office and realized that it wasn't what I wanted to do. I decided to take some time off after I got my degree. Two years later, and I'm living in Colorado.</p>

			<p class="center"> I came to Denver with little to no plan. My only goal was to figure myself out. I worked as a personal trainer to get by. I found myself extremely interested in personal training, but I also felt a nagging feeling that it was not a career. This led me to Physical Therapy. I worked as a Physical Therapy Technician and a Chiropractic assistant. I also enjoyed this, but did not find the same passion that I found with personal training. After watching a TED talk, I realized that while I knew how to use technology, I barely knew anything about how it worked. As a result,  I began teaching myself to code. Coding offers me an outlet to build things without the drag of physical labor. This is what led me to the gSchool. </p>
